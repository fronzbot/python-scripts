# python-scripts

This repo contains a bunch of python scripts I run on periodically on my system.  I use this in conjunction with my [python docker](https://github.com/fronzbot/docker-python) which allows me to schedule scripts via a `config.yaml` file.

# Current scripts:

- `make_gif.py`: Creates a gif from a series of images (I use this for [home-assistant](https://home-assistant.io))
- `save_gif.py`: Simply saves a gif.  I schedule this to run daily.
